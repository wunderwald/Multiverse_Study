# MEASURING RSA SYNCHRONY

## Idea

- Calculate continuous RSA of mother and infants
- Remove linear dependencies: substract 1st derivative from cont. rsa
- Calculate cross-correlation between detrended signals
- select lag-0 coefficient as measure of synchony
	-> corellation value for phase_shift = 0
- window sizes for calculating cont. rsa: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 seconds

## Matlab

- Linear detrending: detrend(signal)
- Cross-correlation: xcorr(x, y, maxlag) => lags in range [-maxlag, maxlag]
