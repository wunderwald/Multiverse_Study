import genetic as gen

# goal: have one function gen.optimize_genetic(*hyperparams) that returns given number of best individuals / arr induvidual with fitness under threshold

# hyperparams: popsize, maxgenerations, fitness_threshold (threshold that implies convergence, algorithm stops here), distance_metric, crossover_method, selection, mutation
